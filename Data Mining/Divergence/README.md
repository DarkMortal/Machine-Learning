# Divergence techniques
2 of the most prominent techniques to quantify the difference between 2 probability distributions.
- KL Divergence: Not symmetic.
- JS Divergence: Is symmetric.
## Clarification on Sample Size and Distribution Size
- **Sample Size:** Refers to the number of data points used to estimate the distributions $P$ and $Q$.
- **Distribution Size:** Refers to the number of elements (e.g., bins, categories, or dimensions) in the probability distributions $P$ and $Q$.
